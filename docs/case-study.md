#### Case Study

A founder of an e-commerce company vibe-coded a web-shop for his business selling
funny t-shirts. And it works! ... kind of. You’ve just joined the company as the first frontend
engineer. The current application is written in react and loads the entire product list
(including product details) from a single endpoint. When you click on a product then the
product details are shown, including image, description, reviews, similar products. The
founder notes that the images also always take a long time to load. The payments are
handled by a third-party integration and work well.

As the product list has grown, the founder has noticed the website (which opens on the
product list page) takes longer and longer to load. He also noticed that he could not easily
find his products while using google search. While the t-shirts were the funniest t-shirts
ever, and people loved them, the founder couldn’t help but feel he could be selling more if
these technical things could be improved upon.

Your task is to provide a plan on how the website can be improved to make the founder sell
more T-shirts and earn more money. The founder has set up a meeting with him and a
freelance backend engineer who will be able to make any changes required to the backend.
You will need to be able to explain why the choices you’ve made will be beneficial i.e.
present and justify your technical decisions. (Note* beneficial both for the end-user, and
for the founder).
